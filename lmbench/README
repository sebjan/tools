1) run lmbench on target:
lmbench-run
 => results are in /var/lib/lmbench/results

2) process these results to extract the data arrays, using a custom python tool: parse.py
 => generates n data files and a gnuplot file

3) do the same for n configurations to compare

4) merge the generated gnuplot files into a single one to plot same kind of data in the same graph

5) customize the gnuplot file, to allow multiple graphs per window:
 can use unix default terminal wxt, or generate png

For png:
set output 'plot1.png' 
set multiplot layout 3, 3

# plot n graphs
...
unset multiplot

then can re-do the same with another output file

sample gnuplot file are provided:
 plot: basic gnuplot setup
 example: generate 2 png files with 9 plots each
